# Pigeomail

- Service which provides securely personal email addresses written in pure Go.
- Using this service, through our telegram bot, one can create an email, receive incoming emails.
- Currently, you can only receive emails, but in future we will add sending emails via the bot as well.
- We don't store the emails on the server, messages sends directly in your telegram, check out my source code. 

# Setting up the project locally:

Step 1: Take a copy of your config from default config (in .deploy folder)

``` cp config.dev.yaml config.yaml ```

Step 2: Up the required containers( docker-compose located in .deploy folder)

Step 3: Generate token from telegram by creating a bot, using @BotFather (https://t.me/botfather)
